print("\n Compiler vs. Interpreter ! \n")

print("1. Compiler :")
print("- Compliler is a translator who translates whole program into machine code at once.")
print("- Execution: Entire Program at Once.")
print("- Fast Speed Because is translates program at once.")
print("- Harder to debug because errors are reported after the entire code is compiled.")
print("- Example: C, C++, Java and Go.\n")

print("2. Interpreter :")
print("- Interpreter is a translator who translates code into machine code line by line.")
print("- Execution: It Executes Line By Line.")
print("- Slow speed because it translates program line by line.")
print("- Easier to debug because as it stops execution when first error encountered.")
print("- Examples: Ruby, Python, and Javascript.")
