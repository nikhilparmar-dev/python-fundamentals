#Ways To Declare an Variable
MyName = "Nikhil"   #pascal case - means first character of every word is capital.
print(MyName)

myName = "iamNikhil"    #camel case - means first character of second word is capital
print(myName)

myname = "nikhil"   #flast case - means all characters should be small.
print(myname)

my_name_ = "I_am_Nikhil"    #Snake case - means _ (Underscore) between words or around the words.
print(my_name_)


# Rules of variables
# 1. Variable name must be in letter, number and underscore.
_Name_of_RollNo_18 = "Nikhil"
print(_Name_of_RollNo_18)

# 2. variables are case sensitive
MyNumber = 85111
# print(mynumber) # This is false
print(MyNumber) # This is true

# 3. Variable names can't be a reserved word or keyword.
# for = 18 # This is false because for is a keyword in python
